Subnautica is an underwater adventure game <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/264710/">available on Steam.</a> It uses an in-built player feedback system. At GDC 2015 this system was presented as part of the IGS Tech Toolbox series of talks.

Subnautica's feedback system is comprised of an in-game Unity GUI front end, a data-presentation web end, and a data-collection back-end.

The implementation of these components is esoteric and specific to Subnautica. The intention of this repository is not to provide a functional or even semi-functional turn-key copy of the system. Instead, it is a collection of some code used in the system that my help you in creating your own implementation of the idea.
